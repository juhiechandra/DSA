Starting Over Again from March 1 2022 after giving inconsistent tries from 18 Jan-17th Feb

The thing is DSA and stuff are long journey

1. Do something daily, don't leave anytime
2. Divide stuff into parts and put efforts in span of 5-6 months
3. Don't do just to take job, do because things will interest you 
4. Don't memorize things rather type them out yourself
5. Don't take peer pressure
